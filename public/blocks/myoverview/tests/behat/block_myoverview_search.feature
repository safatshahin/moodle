  Scenario: There is no search if I am not enrolled in any course
    When I am on the "My courses" page logged in as "student2"
    Then I should see "You're not enrolled in any courses." in the "Course overview" "block"
    And "Search courses" "field" should not exist in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I log out

  Scenario: Single page search
    Given I am on the "My courses" page logged in as "student1"
    And I set the field "Search courses" in the "Course overview" "block" to "Course 0"
    Then I should see "Course 01" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I should not see "Course 13" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I log out

  Scenario: Paginated search
    Given I am on the "My courses" page logged in as "student1"
    And I set the field "Search courses" in the "Course overview" "block" to "Course"
    And I should see "Course 01" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I should not see "Course 13" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I click on "Next page" "button" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I wait until "Course 13" "text" exists
    Then I should see "Course 13" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I should not see "Course 01" in the "Course overview" "block"

  Scenario: A search with no matches shows the no-results state, not the zero-state
    Given I am on the "My courses" page logged in as "student1"
    When I set the field "Search courses" in the "Course overview" "block" to "Nonexistent course zzz"
    Then I should see "No courses match your search" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I should see "Try different keywords or clear your filters to see all courses." in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I should not see "You're not enrolled in any courses." in the "Course overview" "block"
    # The search field stays available so the user can recover from the empty result.
    And "Search courses" "field" should exist in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I log out

  Scenario: Searching overrides the active filter, and clearing the search restores it
    Given I am on the "My courses" page logged in as "student1"
    # Star a course and reload so the favourite is loaded from the server.
    And I click on ".mds-favourite-button" "css_element" in the "//article[contains(concat(' ', normalize-space(@class), ' '), ' courseoverview-card ') and contains(.,'Course 01')]" "xpath_element"
    And I reload the page
    And I wait until "Course 01" "text" exists
    # Apply the Starred filter.
    And I click on "Grouping drop-down menu" "button" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I click on "Starred" "button" in the ".courseoverview-menu__list" "css_element"
    And I should see "Course 01" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I should not see "Course 03" in the "Course overview" "block"
    # A search overrides the grouping (as the pre-React block behaved): matches outside
    # the Starred filter appear while the search is active.
    When I set the field "Search courses" in the "Course overview" "block" to "Course 03"
    Then I should see "Course 03" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I should not see "Course 01" in the "Course overview" "block"
    # Clearing the search restores the user's stored grouping.
    And I set the field "Search courses" in the "Course overview" "block" to ""
    And I wait until "Course 01" "text" exists
    And I should see "Course 01" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I should not see "Course 03" in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I log out
