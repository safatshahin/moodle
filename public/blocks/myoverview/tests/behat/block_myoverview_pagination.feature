  Scenario: The pagination controls should be hidden if I am not enrolled in any courses
    When I am on the "My courses" page logged in as "student1"
    Then I should see "You're not enrolled in any courses." in the "Course overview" "block"
    And "Next page" "button" should not exist in the "Course overview" "block"
    And "Previous page" "button" should not exist in the "Course overview" "block"
    And I log out

  Scenario: The pagination controls should be hidden if I am enrolled in 9 courses or less
    Given the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | student1 | C1 | student |
      | student1 | C2 | student |

      | student1 | C8 | student |
      | student1 | C9 | student |
    When I am on the "My courses" page logged in as "student1"
    Then I should see "Course 01" in the "Course overview" "block"
    # The container-width tier class must be applied (the ResizeObserver drives the
    # multi-column card grid); its absence means the layout is stuck single-column.
    And ".block-myoverview.courseoverview-min-480" "css_element" should exist
    # Assert the LIVE computed layout, including reflow on a real window resize:
    # this exercises the ResizeObserver end-to-end (a detached observer freezes
    # the width tiers, which selector assertions alone cannot detect).
    And the course overview card grid should render "3" columns
    And I change window size to "mobile"
    And the course overview card grid should render "1" column
    And I change window size to "medium"
    And the course overview card grid should render "3" columns
    And "Next page" "button" should not exist in the "Course overview" "block"

  Scenario: Pagination appears with a stored last-accessed sort preference
    # The last-accessed sort joins the user_lastaccess table (a different query shape
    # from the default title sort every other scenario uses), so pin that the paged
    # fetches and the previous/next controls work under it too.
