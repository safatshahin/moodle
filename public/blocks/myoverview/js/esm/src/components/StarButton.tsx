/**
 * Standalone star/favourite control (MDL-88969).
 *
 * Delegates to the DS FavouriteButton — selected/unselected icon state,
 * aria-pressed, focus ring, and hover/active colours are all owned by the DS.
 *
 * Receives isFavourite as a prop (resolved by CourseControls from the membership
 * context) so this component subscribes only to the stable callbacks context and
 * does not re-render when unrelated courses are toggled.
