Feature: Marketplace activity chooser footer
  In order to browse plugins from the activity chooser
  As a teacher
  I need to see the Marketplace footer link when installaddon is the active footer plugin

  Background:
    Given the following config values are set as admin:
      | activitychooseractivefooter | tool_installaddon |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | teacher1 | Teacher | 1 | teacher1@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | format |
      | Course 1 | C1 | 0 | topics |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |

  Scenario: Activity chooser footer includes Marketplace link
    Given I log in as "teacher1"
    When I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I open the activity chooser
    Then "Or browse plugins in Marketplace" "link" should exist in the "Add an activity or resource" "dialogue"
